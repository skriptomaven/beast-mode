# Data Structures and Algorithms

''' An algorithm: A set of step-by-step instructions to solve any given problem.
        - Algorithm processes the data and produces the output results based on the specific problem
        - The data used by the algorithm to solve the problem has to be stored & organized efficiently
        in the computer memory for the efficient implementation of the software.
        - The performance of the system depends upon the efficient access and retrieval of the data,
        and that depends upon how well the data structures that store & organize the data in the
        system are chosen.
        - Data structures deal with how the data is stored & organized in the memory  of the computer
        that is going to be used in the program.
