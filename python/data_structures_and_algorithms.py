# Data Structures and Algorithms

''' An algorithm: A set of step-by-step instructions to solve any given problem.
        - Algorithm processes the data and produces the output results based on the specific problem
        - The data used by the algorithm to solve the problem has to be stored & organized efficiently
        in the computer memory for the efficient implementation of the software.
        - The performance of the system depends upon the efficient access and retrieval of the data,
        and that depends upon how well the data structures that store & organize the data in the
        system are chosen.
        - Data structures deal with how the data is stored & organized in the memory  of the computer
        that is going to be used in the program.

    Data Types:
        These are simple data types
        1. Numeric - Integer(int), float, complex
        2. Boolean - bool
        3. Sequency - String(str), range, list, tuple

        These are complex data types
        4. Mapping - dictionary(dict)
        5. Set - set, frozenset

    0. Strings - HAHAHAHA we all know what strings are just rem that they are immutable

    1. Range - Represents an immutable sequence of numbers
             - Returns a seq. of numbers starting from a given number to a number specified in the
             function argument.
             - It is mainly used in ```for``` and ```while``` loops
             - Use case:
                range(start, stop, step) e.g., print(list(range(20, 10, -2)))
